Also presented are plant biomass, pH of the hydroponic solution and soil biological activity (concentration of Fluorescein diacetate - a measure of the hydrolytic capacity) at the end of the study. The study was funded by the NERC (Grant number NE/M000648/1). Mass spectrometry was carried out in The York Centre of Excellence in Mass Spectrometry; the centre was created thanks to a major capital investment through Science City York, supported by Yorkshire Forward with funds from the Northern Way Initiative, and subsequent support from EPSRC (EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1).
